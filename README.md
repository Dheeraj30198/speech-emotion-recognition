Speech Emotion Recognition using RNN and MFCC features (RAVDESS dataset).
# Speech Emotion Recognition

This project aims to classify emotions from speech using:
- **MFCC features** extracted with `librosa`
- **RNN (LSTM)** for classification
- Dataset: **RAVDESS Emotional Speech Audio**

## Current Progress
✅ Mounted Google Drive in Colab  
✅ Verified dataset upload (RAVDESS subset)  

Next steps: MFCC extraction → RNN training.
